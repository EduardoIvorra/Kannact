### What are the reasons that are making you consider leaving your company? (Apart from the CTO)

They're pushing me into a new project related to AI where I’d have to use C++ and move away from web development, which I don’t want. I expressed that clearly but it didn’t really change anything, so I feel like it’s time to move on.

### What are the three top priority things you would improve in the codebase or development process? Why these?

1. **Testing** – We have really low coverage and we often ship bugs to production. It’s common to have tickets reopened because we miss things. It doesn’t give us confidence when releasing.

2. **Communication with management** – Sometimes we get deadlines that feel impossible for the dev team, and at the same time, there are delays that management can’t understand. We could reduce frustration just by syncing better.

3. **Cross-team collaboration** – Backend and frontend are very disconnected right now, which slows everything down. I'd try to improve that and bring more clarity in communication across teams.

### What makes you a good fit for this role? Why should we choose you over others with similar experience?

I'm someone who really enjoys taking on new challenges and learning. What I liked about this role is the autonomy — being able to take responsibility and make decisions. I’m very self-sufficient and organized, so I don’t need a lot of supervision. For example, I led the full migration of the frontend in my current company in the last 6 months. Tech-wise, I use this same stack every day so I feel really comfortable with it.

## Scenario: You work at Netflix, finish a frontend task, QA tests it, everything looks fine, and QA pushes to production. Then Netflix stops working for users in Spain. You need to fix it ASAP.

### Who is responsible?

I think responsibility is shared across the team. That said, the QA and I would be the most directly involved. We should have considered edge cases like region-specific behavior. But we also need to check if it’s infra-related, which might involve DevOps.

### What do you do to fix it?

First thing is rollback or hotfix right away. After that, I’d check monitoring/logs to identify what exactly broke. I'd work with QA and DevOps to figure it out. For the future, I’d add more tests to catch these region-specific issues.

## Scenario: It’s your first day at a new company. You only get access to Bitwarden for credentials. No one will onboard you.

### How do you spend your first day?

I’d start logging into the tools — Github, Slack, Jira, etc. Then I’d clone the repo and read through the README or any docs. I’d set up the project locally and try to understand the codebase as much as possible. Rest of the day I’d spend exploring the app and how it’s structured.

### What would your priorities be in your first week?

I'd try to get a clear view of the company’s goals and understand the product. Then I’d focus on understanding the code and the day-to-day process of the team. I'd try to make small contributions to get comfortable with the repo. And I’d make sure to talk with the team — at least a quick intro with the people I’ll work closely with.
